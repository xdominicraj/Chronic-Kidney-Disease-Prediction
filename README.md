# Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Prediction
Chronic kidney disease, also called chronic kidney failure, describes the gradual loss of kidney function. Your kidneys filter wastes and excess fluids from your blood, which are then excreted in your urine. When chronic kidney disease reaches an advanced stage, dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and wastes can build up in your body.

We use ML to try and classify the instances of chronic kidney disease based on minerals, RBC, WBC and other lifestyle related parameters.
